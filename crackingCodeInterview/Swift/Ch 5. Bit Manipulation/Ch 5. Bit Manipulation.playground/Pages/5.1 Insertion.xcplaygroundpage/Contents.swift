/*:
 You are given two 32 bit Ints, `n` and `m`, and two bit positions, `i` and `j`.
 
 Write a method to insert m into n so that m starts at bit j and ends at bit i.
 You can assume that bits j through i have enough space to hold m. That is, if
 `m = 10011`, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.
 You would not, for example, have `j = 3` and `i = 2`, because m could not fully fit between bit 3
 and bit 2.
