Given values of two nodes in a Binary Tree, find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). It may be assumed that both nodes exist in the tree.

BST_LCA

For example, consider the Binary Tree in diagram, LCA of 10 and 14 is 12 and LCA of 8 and 14 is 8.

Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself). Source : Wikipedia.
